<p>In this document, the following namespace prefixes are used for the
      given namespace URI from the referenced specification:
</p><table class="full" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

<br clear="all" />

<p>The choices of namespace prefix are arbitrary and not semantically
      significant.
</p>
<p>This specification uses a shorthand form of terms from the XML
      Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204]. The phrase "Information Item" is
      omitted when naming Element and Attribute Information Items. Therefore,
      when this specification uses the term "element," it is referring to an
      Element Information Item in Infoset terms. Likewise, when this
      specification uses the term "attribute," it is referring to an Attribute
      Information Item.
</p>
<p>This specification allows the use of IRIs [RFC3987]. Every URI
      [RFC3986] is also an IRI, so a URI MAY be used wherever an IRI is named.
      When an IRI that is not also a URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST
      be mapped to a URI using the steps in Section 3.1 of [RFC3987]. When an
      IRI is serving as an identifier, it MUST NOT be so mapped.
</p>
<p>Some sections of this specification are illustrated with a non-
      normative RELAX NG Compact schema [RELAXNG]. In those sections, this
      specification uses the atomCommonAttributes, atomMediaType, and atomURI
      patterns, defined in [RFC4287].
</p>
<p>However, the text of this specification provides the sole definition
      of conformance.
</p>
<p>This specification uses "the Atom specification" to refer to <a class='info' href='#RFC4287'>[RFC4287]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;The Atom Syndication Format,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, and "the AtomActivity specification" to refer
      to [insert xref here].

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Base Schema</h3>

<p>The base schema provides generic terms that all activity consumers
      SHOULD support. The other, more specific sections that follow use
      specializations of this base vocabulary to provide additional terms that
      may only be useful in certain applications.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Post</h3>

<p>The "Post" Verb is described in section 8 of the AtomActivity
          specification. It is only referenced here for completeness.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h3>3.1.2.&nbsp;
Share</h3>

<p>The "share" Verb indicates that the Subject has called out the
          Object to readers. In most cases, the actor did not create the
          Object being shared, but is instead drawing attention to it.
</p>
<p>The verb URI for the "share" Verb is <tt>http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/share</tt>.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.3"></a><h3>3.1.3.&nbsp;
Save</h3>

<p>The "save" Verb indicates that the Subject has called out the
          Object as being of interest primarily to him- or herself. Though
          this action MAY be shared publicly, the implication is that the
          Object has been saved primarily for the actor's own benefit rather
          than to show it to others as would be indicated by the "share" Verb
          (<a class='info' href='#share'>Section&nbsp;3.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Share</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>The verb URI for the "save" Verb is <tt>http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/save</tt>.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.4"></a><h3>3.1.4.&nbsp;
Mark as Favorite</h3>

<p>The "mark as favorite" Verb indicates that the Subject marked the
          Object as an item of special interest. Objects so marked often
          appear in a collection of such Objects which MAY be published as a
          feed of entries annotated with this Verb.
</p>
<p>If a particular service uses favorites as a mechanism by which a
          user can recall items that were earlier marked, it MAY be
          appropriate to also mark activities of this type with the "save"

Start Following</h3>

<p>The "start following" Verb indicates that the Subject began
          following the activity of the Object. In most cases, the Object of
          this Verb will be a user, but it can potentially be of any type that
          can sensibly generate activity.

Make Friend</h3>

<p>The "make friend" Verb indicates the creation of a friendship
          that is reciprocated by the object.
</p>
<p>Since this verb implies an activity on the part of its object,
          processors MUST NOT accept activities with this Verb unless they are
          able to verify through some external means that there is in fact a
          reciprocated connection. For example, a processor MAY have received
          a guarantee from a particular publisher that the publisher will only
          use this Verb in cases where a reciprocal relationship exists.

Tag</h3>

<p>The "tag" verb indicates that the actor has identified the
          presence of a target inside another object. For example, the actor
          may have specified that a particular user appears in a photo.
</p>
<p>The verb URI for the "tag" verb is <tt>http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/tag</tt>.
</p>
<p>The target of the "tag" verb gives the object in which the tag
          has been added. For example, if a user appears in a photo, the
          activity:object is the user and the activity:target is the
          photo.

<p>The "blog entry" object type indicates that the Object is an
          entry in a blog or some other similar construct.
</p>
<p>The "blog entry" object type is a specialization of the "article"

          systems where users are invited to publish a timestamped
          "status".
</p>
<p>A note is similar in structure to a weblog entry, but it does not
          have a title and its body tends to be shorter. Applications will
          often display the entire content of a note in an activity stream UI,
          whereas they MAY display only the title or the title and summary for
          a weblog entry.

File</h3>

<p>The "file" Object type represents some document or other file
          with no additional machine-readable semantics.
</p>
<p>It is intended that this type be used as a base type for other
          Objects that manifest as files, so that additional semantics can be
          added while providing a fallback ability for clients that do not
          support the more specific Object type.

              Should there be multiple links with rel enclosure with different
              type attribute value, they are considered to be alternate
              representations of the file. Should there be multiple links with
              rel enclosure and with the <em>same</em> attribute value,
              the meaning is undefined for the file Object type and consumers
              MAY choose to present only the first of each supported type.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.10"></a><h3>3.2.10.&nbsp;
Bookmark</h3>

<p>The "bookmark" Object type represents a pointer to some URL --
          typically a web page. In most cases, a bookmark is specific to a
          given user and contains metadata chosen by that user. Bookmark
          Objects are similar in principle to the concept of bookmarks or
          favorites in a web browser. A bookmark represents a pointer to the
          URL, not the URL or the associated resource itself.
</p>
<p>When dealing with bookmarks it is important to note the
          distinction between the title, description, and URL of the bookmark
          itself and the title, content, and URL of the resource that is the
          target of the bookmark. In some implementations these MAY be the
          same, but bookmark managers often allow a user to edit the title and
          description of his or her own bookmarks to differ from the metadata
          on the target itself.
</p>
<p>Some implementations refer to this Object type as a "link". This
          specification uses the term "bookmark" to avoid confusion with the
          general concept of hyperlinks which apply to all Object types.
</p>
<p>Since bookmarks are often specific to a particular user, even
          though multiple users might have bookmarks pointing at the same
          resource, it is appropriate to use the "post" Verb to describe the
          publication of such a bookmark. The "mark as favorite" Verb SHOULD
          be used when a user flags another user's bookmark as being a
          favorite without creating his own bookmark, or when a user flags his
          own bookmark as being a favorite as a special classification within
          his own bookmark collection.
</p>
<p>The Object type URL for the "bookmark" Object type is <tt>http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/bookmark</tt>.
</p>
<p>A bookmark has the following properties:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>title</dt>
<dd>The title of the bookmark, as entered by the
              user who created the bookmark. Included as the content of the
              atom:title element. Publishers MAY use the title of the target
              resource as a default for this property where a user hasn't
              entered a customized value.
</dd>
<dt>description</dt>
<dd>The description of the bookmark, as
              entered by the user who created the bookmark. Included as the
              content of the atom:summary element. If no description has been
              provided, publishers SHOULD omit this element.
</dd>
<dt>target URL</dt>
<dd>The URL of the item that is the target
              of the bookmark. Represented as the value of the href attribute
              on an atom:link element with rel "related". An entry with this
              Object type MUST NOT include related links except for the
              purpose of representing the target URL.
</dd>
<dt>bookmark page URL</dt>
<dd>The URL of a page that describes
              the bookmark. This URL is often specific to the user that
              published the bookmark. Represented as the value of the href
              attribute on an atom:link element with a rel value of alternate
              and a type value of text/html.
</dd>
<dt>target title</dt>
<dd>The title of the item that is the
              target of the bookmark. Represented as the value of the title
              attribute on the atom:link element from which the target URL was
              obtained.
</dd>
<dt>thumbnail</dt>
<dd>The URL and metadata for a thumbnail
              version of the page. The URL is represented as the value of the
              href attribute on an atom:link element with rel preview and a
              type of either image/jpeg, image/png or image/gif. Publishers
              SHOULD include media:width and media:height attributes on the
              atom:link element describing the dimensions of the linked image.
              Processors MAY ignore thumbnails that are of an inappropriate
              size for their user interface.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Publishers SHOULD include an atom:content element containing
          content that will present the bookmark to the user of a processor
          that does not have special support for bookmarks. Bookmark-aware
          processors SHOULD prefer the specific properties given above, but
          MAY use the content in preference in cases where the properties
          above are incomplete or unsuitable.

Song</h3>

<p>The "tv episode" Object type represents a song or a recording of
          a song.
</p>
<p>Objects of type Song might contain information about the song or
          recording, or they might contain some representation of the
          recording itself. In the latter case, the song SHOULD also be
          annotated with the "audio" object type as described in <a class='info' href='#audio'>Section&nbsp;3.2.9<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audio</span><span>)</span></a> and use its properties. This type should only
          be used when the publisher can guarantee that the object is a song
          rather than merely a generic audio stream.
</p>
<p>The Object type URL for the "song" Object type is <tt>http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/song</tt>.
</p>
<p>A song has the following properties:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>title</dt>
<dd>The title of the movie. Included as the
              content of the atom:title element.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>TODO: Include a way to indicate the artist associated with the
          song, the album a particular recording is from, etc. Recording
          artist could potentially be added as an Object type in its own right
          to allow for this.
